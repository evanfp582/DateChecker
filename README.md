# DateChecker
The first project that I worked on. 
A program that if you input the Day month and year, it will tell you what day of the week it lands on
Utilizes basic parsing and mathamatics

This was the first project that I did with programming. I was doing the "Automate the Easy Stuff with Python" tutorial when I was inspired to do this project
Very inefficient and old prpogram. I could defenitly do this better and quicker now. I guess that shows how I have improved as a programmer throughout the years.
A very fun project none the less
